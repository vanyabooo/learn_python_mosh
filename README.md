# Python Course Progress

This repository documents my progress through the "Python Full Course for Beginners" available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc). The course is designed to take you from zero to hero in Python, covering a wide range of topics from basic syntax to machine learning and web development projects.

## Course Description

The course includes a comprehensive guide to Python, starting with the installation and setup, and progressing through more advanced topics such as data structures, functions, object-oriented programming, and concludes with practical projects in automation, machine learning, and web development using Django.

## Goals

My goal is to complete this course and develop a solid understanding of Python programming. I will be applying the concepts learned in practical projects and documenting my code and learnings in this repository. Also kudos to my mentors: @[dokibyte](https://github.com/dokibyte) and @[windweb](https://www.github.com/windweb/)
